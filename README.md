# OpenCourseWare 6.035

This repository contains some snippets of me working through [OpenCourseWare
6.035](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-035-computer-language-engineering-spring-2010/pages/lecture-notes/),
Computer Language Engineering.

Right now I'm just trying to wrap my head around LALR parsing, but eventually
this may turn into something much bigger.
